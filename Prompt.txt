Write questions according to the chapters I have provided. The questions should be MCQ and open ended. They should be deceiving and contain terminology that seems correct. Use the documents provided to write questions related to the topics discussed. The questions should not require memorization of certain numbers/pointless information. Instead, it should focus on key topics, and key concepts.
Write 15 MCQs and 3 open ended questions per chapter.
