# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a document history caching system that allows users to view and quickly access previously uploaded documents from the home page. The system will store document metadata and provide seamless navigation to document actions (quiz or review) without requiring re-upload.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of my previously uploaded documents on the home page, so that I can quickly access documents I've worked with before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display a "Recent Documents" section
2. WHEN documents have been previously uploaded THEN the system SHALL show document titles, upload dates, and file types
3. WHEN no documents have been uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the document list exceeds 10 items THEN the system SHALL show the 10 most recently uploaded documents

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on a previously uploaded document, so that I can immediately access the quiz or review options without re-uploading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a document from the history list THEN the system SHALL navigate to the document action selection page
2. WHEN the document action page loads THEN the system SHALL display options for "Take Quiz" and "Review Document"
3. WHEN a user selects an action THEN the system SHALL load the document content from cache
4. IF the cached document is no longer available THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-upload the document

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically save my uploaded documents to history, so that I don't have to manually manage my document list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully uploads a document THEN the system SHALL automatically add it to the history cache
2. WHEN a document is added to cache THEN the system SHALL store the document content, metadata, and timestamp
3. WHEN the same document is uploaded again THEN the system SHALL update the existing cache entry with a new timestamp
4. WHEN the cache storage limit is reached THEN the system SHALL remove the oldest documents to make space

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove documents from my history, so that I can manage my privacy and keep my document list organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a document in the history list THEN the system SHALL display a delete option
2. WHEN a user clicks the delete option THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the document from cache and update the display
4. WHEN a user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL return to the normal view without changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the document history to persist across browser sessions, so that my document list is available when I return to the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL retain the document history
2. WHEN a user accesses the application from the same device THEN the system SHALL load the previously cached documents
3. WHEN browser storage is cleared THEN the system SHALL handle the empty state gracefully
4. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement a cleanup strategy for older documents
